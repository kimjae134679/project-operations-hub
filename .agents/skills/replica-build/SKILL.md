description: "기존 앱 재현·클론 맥락에서 재현 앱의 화면과 사용자 흐름 구현 단계가 필요할 때만 사용합니다. 일반 개발이나 URL만으로 활성화하지 않습니다."

## 현재 호출 범위
- 기존 앱 재현·클론을 요청한 작업 맥락에서 이 단계가 필요할 때만 선택한다.
- URL만 있는 질문, 일반 개발·로그인 추가·디자인 수정 요청에 클론 작업을 시작하지 않는다.
- 다음 단계 추천은 그 단계의 구현·배포·게시·결제 승인이 아니다.
- 사용자 승인 범위와 실제 도구·계정 권한을 우선하고 기존 안전·저작권 경계를 유지한다.

# replica-build

## Codex compatibility and authorization

This installed copy is adapted for Codex; the upstream workflow remains scoped to
this skill and the current user-authorized project. Mentions of the next stage
are suggestions, not permission to start it. Do not deploy, publish, change live
accounts/DNS, enable paid services, or perform real payment/refund tests without
separate explicit authorization. Use existing/free local tools by default; do
not call external models or paid APIs merely to run this pack.

Keep the working directory in the authorized project. Resolve bundled helpers
from the actual installed skill directory, not the project current directory.
Discover an existing supported Python interpreter from this runtime or approved
local installation metadata; do not assume a particular PC account or Python version.
In a repository environment, these helpers live beside the SKILL.md files under
.agents/skills. Do not install an interpreter or execute a remote script merely
to use this pack.

Helpers are local standard-library tools, not sandboxes. Use owned, bounded local
inputs; never sweep credential/home directories or symlink/junction/reparse
inputs. PNG decoding has no resource cap, so use trusted ordinary screenshots.
`imgdiff.py --out` and `reviews.py --out` can overwrite a named file: choose a new
owned output, preserve existing data, and do not run on untrusted output paths.
Verify changing service/pricing/store/legal claims with current primary sources;
these instructions and listing limits are not a legal-clearance guarantee.

Reads `replica/recon.md`, `replica/architecture.md`, `replica/design/`.
Updates `replica/features.csv` (the `clone` column) and keeps
`replica/build-log.md`.

## The rules

- **Clean room.** Every line of code is written here, from the recon map and
  the specs. Never paste the original's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVGs or
  images, never load anything from its domain or CDN, never "view source and
  adapt".
- **Your words.** Write every label, button, empty state and email fresh.
  Matching what a button does is parity. Matching its sentence is copying.
- **Tokens only.** No raw hex or pixel values in components. If a value is
  missing, add it to the tokens.

## Step 1: the shell

Routing for every screen in the inventory (stub pages are fine), the layout
(nav, header, sidebar), tokens wired in, the primitives from replica-design,
and seed data so screens have something real to show. Commit.

## Step 2: the vertical slice

The core loop from the recon map, end to end, before anything else. For a
booking app: create an event type, open the public page, book a slot, see it
on the dashboard. Ugly is fine. Working is the point. If replica-backend has
not run yet, use the seed data and a fake data layer with the same function
signatures, so swapping in the real one changes no screen code.

## Step 3: screen by screen

Work in the order of `architecture.md`. For each screen:

1. Read its row in the recon map: purpose, components, states, which flows
   pass through it.
2. Look at the reference screenshot for layout and hierarchy. Not for pixels.
3. Build it with the primitives. Real data from the data layer.
4. **Every state**: empty, loading (skeletons, not spinners, if the original
   does), filled, error, no permission, long content (a 60 character name),
   mobile width.
5. Basics, every time: semantic HTML, labels on inputs, keyboard reachable,
   visible focus, images with alt text.
6. Set the matching rows in `features.csv` to `yes` or `partial` (with a note).
7. Screenshot it at the same viewport as the reference into
   `replica/clone-screens/S07.png` for replica-diff.
8. One commit per screen: `build: S07 booking page`.

## Definition of done, per screen

- [ ] every state from the recon map, plus empty, error and loading
- [ ] works at 390px and 1440px wide
- [ ] keyboard only: can complete the flow
- [ ] no console errors
- [ ] no hard-coded copy borrowed from the original
- [ ] features.csv updated
- [ ] screenshot saved for diff

## Step 4: the build log

`replica/build-log.md`, one line per screen: ID, date, done or partial, what
is missing, what was harder than expected. When a feature is bigger than it
looked, say so in the log and in the chat. Do not quietly ship half of it.

## When you are stuck on how something works

Go back to the original as a user: read its help article, watch its public
walkthrough, use the user's own account. Do not dig into its code or network
calls. Then build your own version of the behaviour.

## Output

Screens built, the feature matrix updated, screenshots saved, and a summary:
screens done of total, must-haves done of total, what is next. Then
`/replica-backend` if the data layer is still fake, else `/replica-test`.
